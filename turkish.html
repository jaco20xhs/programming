        <h2>How to Brew</h2><br>
        <div class="steps">
            <p>This brewing method is difficult to master. It takes practice to make a good cup of coffee, but once mastered, the result is worth it. To get started on this challenging brewing method, you will need:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>A turkish coffee pot</li>
                <li>A spoon</li>
                <li>Very finely ground coffee</li>
                <li>(optional) 1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
            </ul><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Place water, coffee, and sugar into the turkish pot. Stir until all the coffee is saturated.</li>
                <li>Place the pot onto the stove on low heat.</li>
                <li>After 5 minutes, the coffee will foam and begin to rise. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Pour the foam into a cup. Place back on heat.</li>
                <li>The coffee will rise again. Remove from heat and pour out the foam.</li>
                <li>Place back on heat. When the coffee rises again, remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Slowly pour out the coffee into the cup.</li>
                <li>Enjoy the fruits of your labor.</li>
            </ol><br>
            <h3>Tips:</h3><br> <!-- due to the complexity of the brew -->
            <ul>
                <li>The coffee should rise within 5 minutes. If it takes longer, increase the heat.</li>
                <li>Always keep an eye on the coffee. It can easily boil over.</li>
                <li>Don't let the coffee come to a boil as it will destroy the foam.</li>
                <li>Tradition dictates to let the coffee rise three times, but many are satisfied with just 1 rise. Experiment and find out what's best for your tastes.</li>
